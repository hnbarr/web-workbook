            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <h4>Visa</h4>
            May 2018 to Present
            <p>Providing phone support to cardholders nationwide. Working in multiple programs and applications to find solutions and resolve problems for cardholders. Only three months after initial on boarding training, I was able to train for other products to assist with additional card programs. Visa has a wonderful environment, which is something that I will definitely seek in all future career moves.</p>

            <h4>Yodle/Web.com</h4>
            January 2017 to November 2017
            <p>What an experience! I have learned so much from my time here.    
            My position was entry level sales when I started, which carried over to another sales position for a Sales Lab for Web.com. The first few months were very difficult for me, however I carried on and pushed myself until I gained success. After my fourth month, I shot to the top of the charts. I was consistent since then, every pay period finishing over goal. Hard work definitely pays off. The position I had at Yodle and Web.com played a major part in who I am today.
